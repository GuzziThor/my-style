        <h1>What is a Living Style Guide?</h1>
          <p>A living style guide is an important tool for web developers to use when they want their fonts, colours, patterns and overall design of their pages consistant throughout the website. Before living style guide tools were created, large complex websites that were developed over time lost their unique styles and their webpages were no longer unified. This was because each team of developers were creating their own unique styles. From this issue, Living style guide tools were created and have since become extremely useful when mutliple teams of developers need their styles to be consistant. </p>
